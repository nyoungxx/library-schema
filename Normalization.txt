Normalization Notes

Original Design (Unnormalized):
- Each book had a single category stored directly in the books table, which led to redundancy if a book belonged to multiple genres.

Normalization Steps:
- First Normal Form (1NF): Separated multivalued categories into individual records.
- Second Normal Form (2NF): Removed partial dependencies by extracting categories into a separate table.
- Third Normal Form (3NF): Eliminated transitive dependencies; books and categories are stored in independent tables.

Why a Join Table:
- Books can belong to multiple categories, and each category can have many books.
- This is a classic many-to-many relationship, which is normalized using a join table (book_categories) that connects book_id and category_id.
